 Convert the Tracking Data from SynthEyes to Axis nodes in Nuke

This is a really really simple tool I've made to convert the Tracking Data from SynthEyes to Axis node.
This is useful for those who need to generate a 2D position using Reconcile node.

Just select the pink point cloud (group node from SynthEyes), and hit "Create Axis" button.

You don't need to install it, just drag and drop on your Node Graph, or save it as a Toolset for your Nuke.

[You don't need to connect the Input/Output from this node].
